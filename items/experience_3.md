### Musical
- I was in my highschoolâ€™s musical.
- In 2019.
- The musical was the Hunchback of Notre Dame and I played one of the gargoyles. I enjoyed the experience of rehearsing the musical and getting to know the other actors.
- My favourite memory has to be the first performance although I was very nervous, I had a lot of fun.
- I did not enjoy how much practice it required because we practised 2-3 times a week for 4 hours at a time which was very draining.
