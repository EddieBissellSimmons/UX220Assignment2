### Highschool
- I attended highschool for 4 Â½ years in downtown Kitchener.
- I attended highschool from 2017 to 2021.
- I enjoyed some of the classes in grade 11 or 12 such as: graphic design, anthropology, and computer science. I also made many friends and still talk with some of them daily.
- My favourite memory during highschool was hanging out with my friends during my spares and walking my friend home through victoria park.
- I did not enjoy working from home during COVID and any mandatory English class.
