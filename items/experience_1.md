### Camping
- I have gone camping at a private campground organised by my church every year for the past 8 years.
- Most recently, I went with my family and some family friends this past year.
- I enjoy the atmosphere and people. The camp organises many fun events such as: tie dye, swimming, and talks about spirituality.
- My favourite memory was when I relaxed with my friends who I have known my whole life and have grown up with.
- I donâ€™t enjoy packing for the camping trip nor do I enjoy camping when it's thunderstorming.
